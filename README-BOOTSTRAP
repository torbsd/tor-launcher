HOW TOR LAUNCHER USES BOOTSTRAP STATUS MESSAGES

(This information was originally recorded in
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/22232)

To start monitoring events, Tor Launcher issues the following Tor
control port command:
  SETEVENTS STATUS_CLIENT NOTICE WARN ERR
Tor Launcher then looks for 650 responses.

When one of the following responses is received, it is logged to
the browser console and added to an in-memory log buffer (which is
used to implement "Copy Tor Log To Clipboard"):
  WARN, ERR, DEBUG, INFO, NOTICE

Tor Launcher also issues a GETINFO status/bootstrap-phase command
soon after the control port connection has been established.

When a STATUS_CLIENT message is received, Tor Launcher uses the
info contained within the message to detect bootstrap errors and
to show progress. The GETINFO status/bootstrap-phase response is
used for this same purpose (both kinds of response messages are
parsed and processed by the same code).

Tor Launcher maintains two important pieces of internal state
information about the bootstrap process:

mIsBootstrapDone (Boolean) This is set to true when a STATUS_CLIENT
    BOOTSTRAP event with PROGRESS=100 is received. It is set to false
    when any other STATUS_CLIENT BOOTSTRAP event is received.

mBootstrapErrorOccurred (Boolean) This is set to true when a
    STATUS_CLIENT BOOTSTRAP event with a severity of WARN or ERR, and
    RECOMMENDATION of warn is received. It is set to false when
    mIsBootstrapDone is set to true as well as after the user makes
    changes to their settings (after a SAVECONF is done).

The PROGRESS field of the STATUS_CLIENT messages are used directly
to display the completion percentage (progress bar).

The TAG= keywords within the STATUS_CLIENT messages are used for
two purposes:

1. The values are mapped to localized strings and displayed in the
progress window. If Tor Launcher cannot map the TAG to a localized
string, it displays the SUMMARY text instead (otherwise, the SUMMARY
field is not used).

2. The TAG value along with REASON is used to suppress repeated
errors. When Tor Launcher sets mBootstrapErrorOccurred to true (see
above), an error is shown to the user unless the previous error
displayed had the same TAG and REASON values.

The "Copy Tor Log To Clipboard" button is displayed with the warning
icon when Tor Launcher detects a bootstrap error (see
mBootstrapErrorOccurred above) or when it receives a log message
event with severity of WARN or ERR.

The severity value within a STATUS_CLIENT BOOTSTRAP event is used
to detect bootstrap errors (as described above) and also to determine
the level for local logging.

When displaying errors, Tor Launcher tries to map the REASON values
to localized strings. If this fails, the WARNING text is displayed
instead. HOSTADDR is appended to the error text when it is present.

RECOMMENDATION is part of the information that is used to determine
if a bootstrap error has occurred (as described above).
